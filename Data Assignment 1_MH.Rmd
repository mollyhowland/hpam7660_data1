Previewed drinks data frame

```{r}
country <- drinks$country
beer_servings <- drinks$beer_servings
spirit_servings <- drinks$spirit_servings
wine_servings <- drinks$wine_servings
total_litres_of_pure_alcohol <- drinks$total_litres_of_pure_alcohol
```

Defined drinks variables

A "tidy" data set in R means that it is one where each variable has it's own column. Tidy data is in a narrow format, unlike messy data in a wide format. 

```{r}
drinks_smaller <- drinks %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("USA", "China", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia")) %>% 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% 
  rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings)
drinks_smaller
```

Previewed drinks smaller data 

The drinks smaller data is not in a tidy format, because each variable has it's own corresponding column.

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

Converting the drinks smaller data frame into a tidy format, I use the  pivot_longer function, and names_to to the alcohol type. I use values_to argument to include the serving sizes, and use cols to define what data I want/don't want as tidy. I input -country, indicating I don't want to dity the country variable. 

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

Previewing drinks smaller new tidy format data frame

```{r}
airline_safety
?airline_safety
```

Using help function for airline safety data frame. 

```{r}
airline_safety_smaller <- airline_safety %>% 
  select(airline, starts_with("fatalities"))
airline_safety_smaller
```
Making an airline safety smaller data set, with fatalities as a variable. 

```{r}
airline_safety_smaller_tidy <- airline_safety_smaller %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "fatalities",
               values_to = "count",
               cols = c(fatalities_85_99, fatalities_00_14))
airline_safety_smaller_tidy
```

Making the airline safety data set tidy, using values_to to measure fatality counts, and cols function to ensure that the fatalities for all of the years are tidied. 

```{r}
library(readr)
dem_score <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```
Loaded the external dem score data using the csv function. 

```{r}
glimpse(dem_score)
```
Previewed dem score data using glimpse function, and saw that it was not in a tidy format.

```{r}
dem_score_tidy <- dem_score %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "year",
               values_to = "democracy_score",
               cols = -country,
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))
dem_score_tidy
```

The dem score data was already small, so I just made it tidy using the same code format as for the other data. For the cols function I did -country because I wanted all of the countries represented in the data set. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
